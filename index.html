			<div>

                <p>Hello there!</p>

                <p>I'm Paul Sivertsen. I'm an audio engineer with over 29 years of experience in live theater/concert production. I was often tasked with compiling SFX palettes for the shows, sometimes requiring extensive searches through sound effects libraries. I also recorded and designed many of my own sound effects. I've worked in both Mac and Windows most of my life, giving me strong confidence in both operating systems.</p>

                <p>Before I went to Full Sail University, I took 3 1/2 years of classical piano training, granting me the ability to read, play from, and even compose sheet music. My first job was working as a sales associate for a now-defunct NJ chain called Compact Disc World. There, I gained broad exposure to many different sorts of music, as well as a strong proficiency in conducting database searches, and a typing speed of over 90 words per minute. I was eventually promoted to manager when the chain was sold to a corporate buyer.</p>

                <p>After earning my Associate's and Bachelor's degrees in Recording Arts at Full Sail, as well as Operator certifications for Pro Tools, two Perfect Attendance Awards, and two Course Director Awards in Advanced Audio Workstations and Professional Writing, I moved out to Los Angeles to further my career in professional audio. I completed an internship at Dark Child Studios in Hollywood where I was allowed to engineer recording sessions with signed artists and lead a team of 5 in the meticulous and efficient completion of various studio tasks.</p>

                <p>In August 2012, up to the present day, I relocated back home to Wayne, NJ to take over head engineering and ownership of Rave Review Productions. Between Nov. 2013 and May 2014, I also worked at Guitar Center as a Pro Audio Sales Associate where I expertly advised numerous customers on equipment purchases. Between Nov. 2013-Nov. 2014, I played drums and did live sound for my mother's church. I'm currently looking for an audio engineering position with a more stable salary as both the pandemic and the FCC essentially ruined my freelance business.</p>

                <p>This is a recent song I composed the majority of in an app called Band Lab. My friend Al and I started a music project together called Halycon Sisyphus, and this is the first song under that name. Al added the guitar after a number of jam sessions, and my friend Sam was the female vocalist on the track. This is an example of Lo-Fi music, stuff that is meant to sound low-fidelity for artistic purposes. It tends to be used as background music while people study, read, etc.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of the sound design assets I used for my first prototype UDK level. I went for a survival horror motif, so you'll hear a number of effects intended to be unsettling.</p>

            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_2aPcc8qyY?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>This is a video I made demonstrating the sounds I placed into this prototype level using UDK during my Advanced Interactive Audio class at Full Sail. We were all tasked with designing 40 assets, naming them precisely according to the asset list, constructing a project hierarchy in FMOD, and then importing them into our prototype UDK level.  </p>

            <p>I paid meticulous attention to the sound cues, the min/max distances, and the various ambient zones to create as realistic and immersive an environment as possible. Additionally, I opted for a survival horror motif with the stinger sound effects. Finally, the engine loop sound didn't make it through the screen-capturing process very well for some reason, but it's there. </p>


            <h3 class="mb-3 text-center">Diablo III - Monk Trailer</h3>

            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S-YlbPdQy4Q?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>This is my edit of the Monk trailer for Diablo III that I did as my individual final project during October 2009 for Audio Post-Production at Full Sail. As stated at the beginning of the video, I do not claim to own the rights to any of the music nor visual content. This is strictly for demo purposes only.</p>

            <p>A little about this video: My instructor cautioned me about choosing a 3-minute trailer, but I didn't see any cause for concern. That is, until I had to spend an extra 12 hours completing the small sound effects for the combat scenes and such. I was also the only member of my group to include dialogue and all Foley elements to my clip. This is actually the third version of this trailer I've released. Regardless of how much daunting work went into it, I think it was well worth all the effort.</p>

            <p>Anyway, I originally mixed it in surround with some creative panning of certain sound effects. The surround mix obviously sounds much better, but I feel confident I did justice to my work in the stereo mix. Word to the wise for any peers who may be reading this: Use a correlation meter on your master fader so you can catch any potential phase issues.</p>


            <h3 class="mb-3 text-center">Horizontal Re-Sequencing and Vertical Re-Orchestration</h3>

            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wbZrDj6-f6Y?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>This is a demonstration of two adaptive audio concepts, "Horizontal Re-sequencing," and, "Vertical Re-orchestration." I explain the basics of both before demonstrating them in the Max/MSP patches. Adaptive audio in general is simply audio that changes based on a player's actions, whether it's something that's triggered by the press of a button or something more passive like moving from one area in the game to the next.</p>
